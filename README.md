# Covid-19_Data

After reading on the news about the huge blunder by PHE on their daily Coronavirus case reporting, which was so bad it ended up meaning a few thousand
exposed people were not contacted through Track and Trace(!), I was inspired to try making my own dashboard to show daily COVID-19 data. Of course, I know the data
I am using is already collated and cleaned up, and the errors within whatever .xls template was being used for their data would not be able to affect mine, I still 
felt this would be an interesting project for me, and one where I could spend more time querying, analysing and presenting my data than preparing it. (p.s. don't take this 
as me dissing data preparation, this is a vital part of data analysis that I would never typically gloss over, it's just handy to have some "oven-ready" data to play with!)

I follow the Coronavirus data, more for my interest in data analysis and data visualisation. This is a rare and unprecedented time, which has drawn a lot of focus to 
particular data reporting. Because the data is free to download and access from https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/, it's a good starting project for me. 

My goal of this project is to create my own personal dashboard, to look at the data I am most interested in, this will include a daily count of new cases and deaths, and will
also include (what I can't take from the main .gov dashboard), details of new cases specifically in my local area.

I plan to push myself to query the data in new ways, to see if I can get any new insights from the data, rather than just regurgitating what I can already see on the online 
dashbaords.

I am also using this project to showcase my skills across a variety of software, and I plan to use both SQL and Python to showcase my data analysis skills across both programming 
languages. I then will create a few versions of my dashboard, and also create report style visualisations. I plan to use this project in particular to develop my skills in SSIS and 
SSRS, and showcase my skills in Tableau.

The files will not always just be code, and will also include some of my notes from my learning.
